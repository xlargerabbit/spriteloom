## What it is

A WebSocket server that runs a diffusion model locally, plus an Aseprite
extension that talks to it. You stay in Aseprite the whole time; results
open in a side window and drop in as new layers on click. It never edits
your existing pixels.

Four tasks, one panel:

- **Generate** — a sprite from a text prompt.
- **Edit with AI** — change an existing sprite by instruction ("make the
  sword glow blue"); style and everything unmentioned stays put.
- **Inpaint Selection** — same, but only ever touches the selected region.
- **Rotate + Instruct** — re-view the same subject from another angle.

Everything runs on a single model (FLUX.2 Klein), so there are no model
swaps: after the first load, tasks respond in seconds.

## Hardware you need — read this first

This runs a 4B-parameter diffusion model on your own machine. It is **not**
a lightweight tool:

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| GPU | **NVIDIA, 12+ GB VRAM** (developed on an RTX 5080); 8 GB GPUs work too, in **Legacy 8 GB mode** — see below |
| RAM | **16 GB minimum.** Legacy 8 GB mode holds the whole ~16 GB model in system RAM, so free RAM plus the Windows page file must comfortably clear that — see below |
| OS | Windows |
| Python | 3.11+ |
| Aseprite | 1.3+ |
| Disk | ~15 GB for the model (downloaded during Setup) |

No NVIDIA GPU, no Spriteloom. There is no CPU fallback and no cloud
option by design — the whole point is that it runs locally.

### VRAM modes

Setup's **VRAM mode** dropdown picks how the ~8 GB transformer is fit onto
the GPU:

- **Auto** (default) — detects free VRAM and picks bf16 on 12+ GB cards,
  Legacy 8 GB mode below that.
- **bf16** — the whole model stays resident on the GPU. Fastest; needs 12+ GB
  free VRAM.
- **Legacy 8 GB mode** — for 8 GB cards (e.g. a laptop RTX 4060). The model
  doesn't fit on the GPU all at once, so it moves one layer onto the GPU
  right before that layer runs, then swaps it back out to system RAM. VRAM
  usage stays low the whole time (one layer resident, not the whole model),
  and so does GPU utilization: most of the time goes to shuttling weights
  over PCIe, not to compute, and that is the actual reason this is slow.
  Output is identical to bf16, just much slower. There is no faster 8 GB
  path currently. An fp8-quantized mode was tried and measured no better
  than this, while adding a real quality risk, so it was dropped.

  Legacy 8 GB mode keeps the whole ~16 GB model in **system RAM** (that is
  where layers are swapped from). On a 16 GB machine that only fits with a
  generous Windows page file, so leave it enabled and sized (or set it to
  system-managed). If free RAM plus page file cannot cover the model the load
  fails; the server now checks this at startup and prints why instead of
  crashing.

## Install

1. Download the latest build from
   [itch.io](https://vkarach.itch.io/spriteloom) and unzip it anywhere. It
   has `Spriteloom.exe`, `server/`, `plugin/`, and the optional `mcp/`
   package together; nothing else to fetch first.
2. Windows will likely show a "Windows protected your PC" SmartScreen
   warning — `Spriteloom.exe` isn't code-signed, so it has no reputation
   yet. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
3. Press **Setup**. It shows what is missing: the environment, PyTorch,
   the dependencies, the plugin, the model (~15 GB), a Start Menu shortcut.
4. Tick everything and press **Install selected**. It builds the `.venv`,
   installs the packages and the plugin, downloads the model, adds a Start
   Menu shortcut, and prints a live log. Restart Aseprite once the plugin
   is in.

Setup also offers optional **MCP tools** for coding agents. Select that row
to install the stdio adapter in its own small environment under `mcp/.venv`.
See [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md) to connect an agent such as Codex CLI.

**Start** stays disabled until every required piece — including the model —
is in place; there is no lazy first-run download.

  <br><em>Setup in action, sped up.</em>
</p>

If you would rather do it by hand:

1. `py -3 -m venv .venv`
2. `.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r server\requirements.txt`
3. `.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`
4. `install-plugin.bat`, then restart Aseprite.

With the `.venv` set up this way, `start-server.bat` starts the server in a
console window instead of through the launcher.

To build a Windows release zip from a full clone, install the launcher build
dependencies and run the release script on Windows x64:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r launcher\requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\build_windows_release.py
```

The output is `dist/Spriteloom-<version>-windows-x64.zip`. It contains the
launcher exe and the source files needed for setup and the optional MCP adapter.
The model, PyTorch, and virtual environments stay outside the archive. See
[mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md) to configure an stdio MCP client from the zip.

## Use

1. Run `Spriteloom.exe`, press **START** and leave the window open. The dot
   turns green once the model is resident, about 25 seconds after a warm
   start. Closing the window stops the server.
2. In Aseprite: **Sprite → Spriteloom...** (or press **F1**). Pick a task,
   fill the fields, press **Run**. Results open in a separate window; click
   a variant to insert it as a new layer.
3. **Generate** understands full sentences: pick a **View** preset, name the
   **Subject** ("closed book with dark brown leather cover"), add **Extra**
   details if needed — the panel shows the exact text it will send.
4. **Edit / Inpaint** take instructions, not a strength slider: say what to
   change and how much. Inpaint only touches the selection.
5. **Rotate / Instruct**: name the subject explicitly ("four-legged brown
   horse", not "character"). Optional **Mirror symmetry** forces the result
   left/right symmetric, which can help a front/back view hold together -
   but it mirrors everything, including a one-handed weapon or an
   asymmetric pose, so it can also make those look wrong. Try it, don't
   assume it's always the better result.
6. **Advanced...** opens a separate window with Background, Palette, Seed, and
   Extra (appended to the prompt for Generate and Rotate/Instruct; Edit and
   Inpaint ignore it).
7. **Background**: Auto detects and strips a uniform background, Remove
   strips the dominant border color, Keep leaves it fully opaque.
8. **Palette**: Auto derives colors per result; Current palette pins output to
   the open sprite's whole palette; Selected colors pins to only the swatches
   highlighted in the palette bar; Palette file pins to a `.gpl`/`.pal`/`.png`
   file so a batch of sprites shares one set of colors.
9. **History** browses past generations (stored in `output/`), newest first;
   click a run to see its variants, click a variant to insert it.

## How it works

```
+-----------------------+                     +---------------+       +--------------------+
| Aseprite plugin (Lua) |  <-- WebSocket -->  | Python server |  -->  | FLUX.2 Klein (GPU) |
|   dialogs, results,   |                     |   protocol,   |       |  single resident   |
| history, layer insert |                     |  postprocess  |       |  model, no swaps   |
+-----------------------+                     +---------------+       +--------------------+
```

- **One model, one warm-up.** Every task hits the same FLUX.2 Klein pipeline,
  so there is no per-task load/unload. On 12+ GB cards it stays fully
  resident; on 8 GB cards (Legacy 8 GB mode) each layer streams to the GPU
  per task instead, which is where that mode's extra time goes.
- **WebSocket protocol** with request validation at the boundary and
  streamed progress messages back to the plugin (`server/protocol.py`,
  `server/main.py`).
- **Postprocess pipeline** turns raw diffusion output into a clean sprite:
  crop to subject, palette quantization, background removal, mirror
  symmetry, fit-into-canvas (`server/postprocess.py`).
- **The plugin is modular Lua** with pure, unit-tested prompt assembly and a
  UI layer tested against a stubbed Aseprite API — see below.

### Quantization note

8-bit quantizing the Klein *transformer* produces pure noise in
text-to-image (edits work fine). The shipped setup sidesteps this: 8-bit
text encoder + bf16 transformer, fully resident. See [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Development

**Server tests:**

```
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest server/tests/ --ignore=server/tests/smoke.py
```

**Prompt tuning without Aseprite** (writes raw + postprocessed variants to `output/`):

```
.venv\Scripts\python -m server.tests.smoke "demonic sword" --size 64
```

**Plugin tests** (needs `scoop install lua luacheck`, user-scoped):

```
luacheck plugin\*.lua plugin\tests\*.lua
lua plugin\tests\test_prompt.lua
lua plugin\tests\test_panel.lua
```

`luacheck` bundles Lua 5.4 (the version Aseprite runs); `.luacheckrc`
declares the API globals it injects. `test_panel.lua` loads every module
against a stubbed Aseprite API and repaints the status canvas in each server
state — this catches broken cross-module calls without launching the editor.
Layout and ghosting still need a real Aseprite.

### Plugin layout

| file | holds |
|---|---|
| `main.lua` | entry point, registers the menu command |
| `dialogs.lua` | the control panel |
| `results.lua` | results window (fresh variants) |
| `history.lua` | history list and single-run windows |
| `ui.lua` | theme colors, checkerboard, variant grid, prompt preview |
| `sprite.lua` | frame/mask export, inserting variants as layers |
| `prompt.lua` | prompt assembly and key maps (pure Lua, unit-tested) |
| `client.lua` | WebSocket client |
| `base64.lua` | base64 codec |

### Launcher layout

| file | holds |
|---|---|
| `launcher/app.py` | the window, the JS bridge, window sizing |
| `launcher/ui/index.html` | markup and styles, main and setup screens |
| `launcher/server_proc.py` | the server subprocess, port probing, health |
| `launcher/plugin_install.py` | copying the plugin, version comparison |
| `launcher/paths.py` | finding the root, Python, Aseprite and the model |
| `launcher/setup_checks.py` | what the setup is missing, detection only |
| `launcher/setup_steps.py` | running the install steps in order |
| `server/config.py` | the settings, shared by the launcher and the server |

The launcher owns the settings file `%APPDATA%\Spriteloom\config.json`: the
port, the VRAM mode, and the setup paths all live there, and every write
merges so one key never erases another. The port defaults to 8765, and
**Install** stamps it into `server.json` next to the plugin, so both ends
agree.

The server runs inside a Windows job object that dies with the launcher.
That is what keeps a crashed or killed launcher from leaving a server behind
holding your VRAM.

## Troubleshooting

If the server says it crashed or never finishes loading, run the built-in
loader check from the install folder:

```
.venv\Scripts\python -m server.diagnose
```

It prints package versions, memory headroom, and whether the model files are
complete, then loads the transformer on its own. `TRUNCATED` means the
download was cut short — delete the model folder and re-download via Setup. A
crash only in the full run, with the isolated load passing, is memory: close
other apps or raise the Windows page file. The server runs the same file and
memory checks at startup, so this is mainly for a closer look.
